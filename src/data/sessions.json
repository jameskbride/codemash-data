Invite a helper into your conversation that can perform routine tasks tirelessly, conversationally, and interactively.\r\n\r\nIn this 4 hour workshop, you will build a Slack bot that understands natural language and integrates with your DevOps pipeline. You will use the Slack Events API to receive messages, and the Slack Web API to send them. You will use LUIS to interpret language and extract intent. You will execute actions against the Visual Studio Team Services Web API in response to user requests, and subscribe to Webhooks to notify your team of important events. In the end, you will have a new member of your team who can help you with your build and release pipeline.\r\n\r\nWorkshop outline:\r\n\r\nSlack API\r\n* \tAuthorization - OAuth and API key verification\r\n* \tEvents API - respond to posts\r\n* \tWeb API - post messages\r\n* \tIdentify users and channels\r\nLUIS\r\n* \tSpecify intents and entities\r\n* \tTrain your app\r\n* \tEvaluate utterances\r\n* \tCall LUIS from your Slack bot\r\nVSTS\r\n* \tWeb API - interrogate source repository and build status\r\n* \tWebhooks - respond to checkins and build completions\r\n* \tCall services asynchronously to keep the conversation going\r\n* \tRespond to the requester when events happen\r\n",

Protocol-oriented programming is a fundamental paradigm in Swift development and powerful way to extend functionality without the complications of inheritance. ARKit, announced at WWDC 2017, provides a platform for stunning new augmented reality experiences. We'll combine the two into a fun \"The Floor Is Lava\" game that will level up your Swift skills and provide a solid foundation for exploring iOS development even further. ",

Before you can do that, you have to be able to consistently apply a simulated user “load” to the site, and measure the performance.  In this session you will start with a functional Python Django web app running in AWS along with some vaguely defined load targets.  From there we'll walk through establishing a user interaction model and implementing it in locust.io, a Python-based distributed load testing tool. That user model will be used to load the web app under test, establish baselines and pick some metrics and interactions to target. We'll then experiment with a few common scaling techniques to demonstrate quantitative improvements.  You’ll gain practical, hands-on experience with load testing concepts and methods.\r\n\r\nLanguages: Python",

Business analysts make mistakes because they misunderstand the stakeholders. The result are defects that typically go unnoticed until the software has been implemented, which leads to expensive and time-consuming rework. Quality requirements are the nexus of understanding for stakeholders, designers, developers, testers, and customers. In this workshop, you will learn how to develop a set of quality requirement standards to reduce the cost of quality and meet the customer’s needs. The training will leverage the industry practice of Behavior Driven Development, which promote requirements by example & collaboration, to develop a shared language across not only a team but the whole enterprise. The shared language is written in Gherkin format (Given, When, and Then specifications) to define requirements independent of application type and focused on delivering value that everyone in the organization understands.

        "Abstract": "Are important words often left unsaid at your place of work? Do you feel like you're navigating a complex maze in conversations? Does your message tend to miss the mark with co-workers, who increasingly seem to be impediments to reaching your goals? Are these unspeakable truths in your workplace that you wish someone would resolve for you?\r\n\r\nTrust and communication issues within the workplace can hollow out an organization. Invisible lines get drawn. Alternate forms of communication open up to subvert perceived rivals. Allies are recruited, reinforcing an us vs. them behavior cycle. Organizations are suffering from a lack of trust, and it's costing them speed, productivity, and collaboration. What can YOU do about it?\r\n\r\nRegardless of your title, you can be a leader in your organization, and a leader's first job is to inspire trust. In this session, Allison and Marcus will share models to evaluate your own behaviors and facilitate activities to help you find your voice for speaking the truth in a way that builds trust. Softening the truth can feel comfortable in low trust environments--it's simpler, nicer, and can make you look like a team player. It can also lead to miscommunication, undelivered news, and blame shifting. On the other hand, saying the truth in all of its ugliness is risky and potentially career-limiting. Finding the sweet spot of communication to become a trusted leader takes self-awareness and practice. Attend this workshop and learn to recognize how your behavior is building trust--or not--and practice speaking hard truths so that others can hear it.",

This advanced session contains cutting-edge information *not* easily found online, and does *not* require a PhD in Machine Learning to understand. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) can be used to generate text that will look like its original training data. There are many [articles](http://lewisandquark.tumblr.com/tagged/neural+networks) out there that show hilarious end-results of such adventures, but start-from-scratch walkthroughs that show the raw code, like this one, are hard to come by. This presentation will demonstrate what you need to join in, grab your own data set, process it, train it, and sample it. Training the data on a CPU can take hours, but in this session you can learn how training on a GPU with hardware acceleration takes only seconds. Come away from this session with your own datasets to “randomly” generate new bodies of text!\r\n\r\nHands-On attendees will find and pull their own dataset, pre-process it, sample, and train it.

We have all sat through the boring Top10 lectures and read the secure coding standards. Now let’s learn what we are protecting our self from. Capture the Flag (CTF) tournaments are a good way of honing your security skills, or discovering skills you never knew you had. The CodeMash CTF kicks off in mid-December and runs through the final day of CodeMash. This precompiler session will be ran in an open house format, to answer any questions you may have, and provide an area for you to sit down with others participating and network your skills to help solve the challenges.  Attend for 4 minutes or 4 hours. Stop by before or after attending a different session, or during a break at a different class. We will give you the rundown and you can stay and play for as long as you like! More information can be found at https://codemashctf.com/",

Things like blocking known bad actors, first level authentication/session lookups, data enrichment, throttling, preliminary user validation, and a host of other problems can be safely pushed to the edge and provide a very useful boost to overall system performance and stability.\r\n\r\nJoin Aaron as he demonstrates how to create custom NGINX modules to solve these issues. Aaron will begin by demonstrating the NGINX lua programming model and then dig into traditional module development in C. He will leave you with working custom module code that you can use and adapt, as well as useful skeletons, local test environment tricks, and reusable test harnesses that ensure you can get moving on your work quickly and efficiently post-compiler. Attendees will walk away with the following knowledge.\r\n\r\n* How to build and deploy a custom NGINX module in Lua and C\r\n* How to test custom NGINX modules\r\n* A deep understanding of the NGINX request lifecycle\r\n* How to create self contained local development environments\r\n* How to tap into advanced NGINX functionality",

Now, in addition to the preprocessors, we have postprocessors, build systems, and CSS components—not to mention the latest and future CSS features! In this workshop, we’ll help get you up to speed on these various approaches to writing CSS, their advantages, and how you can start using them. Whether you're a regular CSS practitioner ready to level up or a backend dev expanding your skillset, we’ll cover all you need to organize, manage, and write modern CSS.\r\n\r\n### We’ll cover many of the new tools, practices, and techniques prevalent in CSS today.\r\n* Naming conventions (BEM, SMACSS, etc.)\r\n* CSS processors (Sass, PostCSS, Autoprefixer, etc.)\r\n* Build tools\r\n* Mixins and Functions and Plugins\r\n* New CSS features and how to use them (plus previews of CSS4 features)\r\n* Tips and tricks to common CSS problems\r\n\r\n### What to bring:\r\n* A practical knowledge of CSS—we’ll be diving into some advanced areas in this workshop.\r\n* A CodePen.io account (they’re free!)—we’ll be putting several concepts in practice, utilizing CodePen in some cases.\r\n* Optionally, we have examples of more advanced tools—in which case, it would be helpful to have Node.JS installed beforehand.\r\n* And a computer, of course!",

No doubt you have found yourself spending to much time fixing an inconsistent suite of tests. You might even be asking yourself \"are these tests even worth it?\". (the answer is yes!)\r\n\r\nLets explore where things typically break down in the acceptance testing process. Starting with breaking  user stories into acceptance criteria, and how the words the team chooses can affect the software that is built. Then taking a deep dive into best patterns and practices in automating the scenarios with cucumber and other ruby modules.\r\nAlong the way answering questions such as how should I manage my test data? Should I ever delete tests?  And, how do I keep my test pyramid from becoming a test cupcake?\r\n\r\nAttendees will walk away from this session armed with information to help them write better acceptance criteria, and tips to keep their test suites clean and less brittle.\r\n",

First, we’ll cover ML, a language whose ideology remains largely unchanged for over 40 years and considered the common ancestor of modern functional languages like Haskell, OCaml and F#. Next, we’ll cover Racket, a LISP derived from Scheme which shares similarities and probably inspiration with a number of currently popular languages, perhaps most obviously, Clojure and perhaps less obviously, Javascript. Lastly, we’re back to where you work: I’ll present exercises that help to reinforce the ideas\r\nlearned from ML and Racket to be solved either in the language of your choosing, or Javascript (the de facto language of examples and\r\nsolutions du jour).\r\n\r\nJoin me for an enlightening foray into some languages largely\r\nforgotten or ignored by the industry that are certain to help you\r\nbring new ideas about functional programming to your daily practice,\r\nwhatever it may be.",

Companies are using the improv methods as a way of creating more innovative and collaborative teams, for brain storming, and creating a work environment that says “Yes” before “No”. Improv training can help students become better learners and make learning more enjoyable. Come and learn about improv and why companies such as IDEO, Google, Marriott, and Twitter have embraced this to build a culture that promotes better communication, collaboration, and team building. This workshop is an interactive workshop. Please attend and have fun learning how to be more positive, vulnerable, attentive, and playful in your daily grind.\r\n\r\nUpon completion of this course, attendees will be able to\r\n1. Identify areas where improv can be used in their work.\r\n2. Perform some basis improv components.\r\n3. Use improv games as tool to innovate and ideate.\r\n4. Understand how failure fits into life-long learning.\r\n5. Exemplify the “Yes And” mantra in their work.",

        "Abstract": "The way we feel is important!\r\n\r\nAll that we think, do, or say is influenced, to some degree, by emotions. Many successful businesses and people recognize the importance of emotional considerations.\r\n\r\nThe way we feel is important and should be considered!\r\n\r\nAll software is intended to help solve some problem, and both problems and solutions evoke emotions. Software requirements are simply wants or needs, which often stem from core emotions. Research shows that emotions can affect the acceptance or rejection of software. \r\n\r\nThe way we feel about software is important and should be considered!\r\n\r\nA placebo is designed and used primarily to evoke emotions. Things like sugar pills, false elevator door close buttons, and fake office thermostats aim “to please”, rather than have any other physical effects. Placebo requirements focus on emotions. And so, considering software through the lens of a placebo can help emphasize emotional considerations, and provide a valuable perspective on bugs, ethical design, and much more.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, I support the claims above, suggest some methods to elicit and test emotional requirements, and finally, use placebos as a lens to view software design and testing. Using presentations, demonstrations, and interactive discussions and exercises, we collaboratively explore why “The way we feel about software is important and should be considered!”\r\n\r\nWorkshop Takeaways:\r\n* Practical methods to get and measure emotional requirements \r\n* A different and deeper understanding of emotions and requirements\r\n* An introduction to the fascinating and spooky world of placebos\r\n",

The tools are similar, and the objective is similar, but the mindset is a little different.\r\n\r\nIn this precompiler, you will spin up a VM you can keep, with some webapps you can test, and tools you can use to test them. You'll learn how to use these free tools to find some vulnerabilities, and - more importantly - understand why they happen. What you learn will make you a more versatile and confident developer or tester, and just might chop a couple of pages off your next pentest report.\r\n",

        "Abstract": "Elm is a typed, functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript. It's famous for ensuring robust applications, and Elm's wildly developer friendly compiler helps developers write elegant, long-lived and safe frontend code. It has recently started drawing widespread attention and is starting to position itself as something other compile-to-js languages hasn't achieved yet - a viable alternative to JavaScript.\r\n\r\nElm utilizes a React-like rendering system, using a tree of pure view functions, while structuring its app using the so-called Elm architecture (which the Redux architecture is loosely based on). All data is immutable, of course, and the language supports fancy features such as algebraic data types, pattern matching and type inference.\r\n\r\nDid this pique your interest? This workshop provides a thorough introduction to Elm, but also serving as a introduction to ML-style typed functional programming. After this workshop you'll be able to judge for yourself whether a language like Elm could ever replace JavaScript as our go-to tool for large-scale web development!",

If you will embrace functional concepts in your every day work, then your code will be cleaner, smaller, and easier to maintain.\r\n\r\nIn this pre-compiler, we will embark on a successive refinement exercise to refactor a horrible deeply nested looping monstrosity into something more elegant and functional.  Along the way, we'll learn about the features in Java that are moving Java into the modern functional world including:\r\n\r\n- Streams\r\n- Map, Filter, Reduce\r\n- Optionals\r\n\r\nThe code exercises for this session will be in Java, but the concepts are equally applicable for JavaScript and C#.",

Advancements in hardware are pushing the boundaries of software development techniques. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe development of autonomous vehicles is challenged with system integration and validation techniques. Traditional product development starts from a physical hardware point of view and then adds software. As hardware complexity increases, companies must drive product development with software. Companies with software at their core are able to accomplish speed to market faster than the spider can spin its web. This is done by driving development with modern software practices such as test driven development and continuous integration.\r\n\r\n\r\nExperience an interactive workshop on how to develop an embedded system while using modern software practices. \r\n\r\n\r\nLearn how to:\r\n- Test drive an embedded component.\r\n- Mock an unavailable component.\r\n- Apply Test Driven Development (TDD), Continuous Integration (CI) and Mocking to achieve a scalable software process on an embedded project.\r\n",

        "Abstract": "Lock-in is a misunderstood concept. Most of the time it's associated willy-nilly with vendors. Open Source is considered a panacea resolving the lock-in issue once and for all. In extreme cases some believe if they write everything from scratch the problem never surfaces. Unfortunately the opposite is true.\r\n\r\nLock-in is when you choose a bespoke solution, including one you create, and the cost of change exceeds your budget. It’s not about vendors. It's not about Open Source. It's about making careful decisions about the cost of change.\r\n\r\nSoftware is best designed by making explicit decisions when options are presented. The CAP theorem is a great example: choose consistency of data or availability of date in the face of a network partition. If you don't make an explicit choice when components can't speak to each other a choice will be made for you.\r\n\r\nLikewise, when selecting components for your architecture the possibility of lock-in always there. Sometimes the organization gains more from making future change more costly by accepting lock-in. In that way lock-in may not be so bad! Often, though, lock-in represents too great a risk. It's important to evaluate these tradeoffs carefully.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I'll describe the thought exercises I've used in making architectural decisions around lock-in. You'll learn how to thing strategically about the implications of building, buying, or using a component in your architecture. These techniques make software design and planning run more smoothly and help you eliminate biases of tribalism and fashion from the process.\r\n",

As companies move toward more and more cloud usage, teams are pushed harder to ensure the same compliance and security requirements that exist in slower moving private environments. This has the potential to put us right back where we came from.\r\n\r\nJoin Aaron as he talks through the most critical security decisions you can make for you AWS environments. He will identify issues and solutions in an automation friendly fashion that aim to fit seamlessly into the development and deployment lifecycle. This session will cover the following topics:\r\n\r\nAccount provisioning and IAM\r\nCredential management\r\nVPC setup and network design\r\nAWS services that boost your security posture\r\nAuditing AWS configurations to find security holes\r\nCreating a robust CI pipeline that ensures no obvious security holes are present within your environments\r\nIn addition to these topics a heavy emphasis on both platform and server automation will be included. Please note that this session is heavily tuned to people using Amazon Web Services.

Those moving to continuous delivery models either ignore security completely or discover that security becomes a bottleneck in their quest to deliver an album…I mean code…rapidly. \r\n\r\nIn this session, we will share how you can create our own “Crimson and Clover” in the form of a Security in DevOps Framework. You can use a framework to allow organizations to establish a baseline of their environment and use it to make informed decisions when trying to fill the security gaps in their continuous delivery pipeline. The a security in DevOps framework offers a benchmark for continuous security improvements while also demonstrating not only that security is important, but that it can be achieved while hitting your DevOps targets. That’s a win-win for everyone involved. \r\nIn this talk, we’ll discuss:\r\n•\tA structured approach to solving the complicated problem of integrating continuous delivery and application security.\r\n•\tHow you can apply a framework to your continuous security model and inform your strategic decisions.\r\n•\tHow to collect evidence and metrics to provide application security guidance at speed and scale.\r\n",

        "Title": "Exploring a NoSQL Option for Storing Data in your Mobile Apps",
        "Abstract": "If your mobile app stores data locally, you’ve probably at least looked at SQLite or Core Data . These come with their share of pain points.  Database schema changes are inevitable with changing requirements and require tedious data migration. Working with SQLite often requires a clumsy mix of SQL with Swift/ObjC/Java/Kotlin and it’s very easy to go wrong. And then, there is the potential impedance mismatch issue to consider while trying to model data as relational tables. \r\n\r\nThis talk will examine NoSQL as an alternative to locally persisting data on mobile platforms. We will provide an overview of the various flavors of NoSQL, focusing on the  Document model. While NoSQL database technologies is gaining traction in large scale distributed applications, we will discuss it’s benefits as an embedded database on mobile platforms for enabling both offline-first and offline-only use cases.\r\n\r\nThen I will introduce Couchbase Lite, an open source, cross-platform NoSQL embedded data store for your mobile apps. We will compare and contrast it with existing solutions. We will discuss how you can integrate this in your mobile apps and walk through examples describing the CRUD and Query interface. \r\n \r\nAt the end of the talk, you will walk away with a good idea of the benefits of NoSQL as a embedded store with Couchbase Mobile as a concrete example. Anyone building a mobile app with local storage needs will benefit from this talk. ",

There will be very little math and lots of coding. The goal is for everyone to become acquainted with Neural Network from a pragmatic standpoint.\r\n \r\nJust when you think it couldn’t get any better, I will show you how to employ the functional paradigm to leverage multicore machines and GPUs to make your neural networks predictions infinitely faster through parallelism. \r\n \r\nBy the end of this talk, you will learn the basic concepts of Neural Network and how to apply functional concurrency to estimate future stock prices at blazing fast speeds…and perhaps get rich while practicing.\r\n",

It had been 15 years since the last significant update to JavaScript, and the front-end world (as we knew it) changed. It has been over a year now and the excitement has ebbed, but our productivity is in flow. We’ve gotten past the novelty of the new features and learned how to use them effectively in everyday code.\r\n\r\nThese 10 insane tips will help you understand when and where to use these new features (including ES2016 and ES2017 features) of JavaScript. We’ll touch on effective use cases of modules, destructuring, template strings, arrow functions, generators, and much more. Using real-world examples, you’ll see how to leverage the new language capabilities for maximum readability and expression. If you haven’t jumped into ES201x, we’ll discuss how to embrace the future while preserving browser compatibility. If you have used it, see how others are using it. We’ll also discuss some future features you can use today, if you feel like living dangerously!",

The way developers and testers collaborate can make the difference between a team that works as a cohesive unit, and a team that works against itself.

As a tester, do you worry that submitting a bug creates unplanned work, threatening the project's timeline? Over time, heavy handoffs can create a gradual accumulation of project risk, an ever-growing backlog of bugs, and, in the worst cases, an adversarial relationship between developers and testers.\r\n\r\nIn this experience report, software tester Clint Hoagland will discuss how TechSmith's Camtasia team moved off a heavy process where dev tasks languished in a \"Ready for Testing\" column for days or even weeks before being tested, and moved instead to a process using exploratory testing artifacts inside GitHub Pull Requests. This process revitalization enabled developers and testers to work comfortably together: reducing risk, minimizing rework, and keeping quality high as a sustainable practice. Clint will discuss where the team started, how it's working now, as well as specific techniques and recommendations the team found along the way.",

Management must accept responsibility for the quality practice within the organization and promote it across the organization. Everyone is responsible for quality, not just QA. The journey is fraught with obstacles -- maturing the quality practice of an organization builds long-term success with robust processes and well-trained employees.",

You're in luck.\r\n\r\nOWASP's Offensive Web Testing Framework (OWTF) was designed to help automate the web app pen testing process. By baking the OWTF into your own QA processes, you can benefit from the same knowledge and tools that the bad guys use to attack web apps. Better yet, you can run these tests as frequently as you like for FREE.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will show you how to use the OWTF, helping you improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of your app security testing process.",

This talk approaches the issue scientifically, and presents ways to deal with this phenomenon, eventually moving beyond it. Geared for developers specifically, but most can identify with a crisis of confidence. In this session we will bring this sensitive subject to light by exploring:\r\n\r\n* Why having this mindset is detrimental to your career \r\n* Identifying the differences between healthy concern and illogical doubt \r\n* What it actually means to ‘fake it till you make it’ \r\n* How believing something negative about yourself can make it really happen \r\n* Ways to cope once you experience a sincere failure \r\n* Learning to graciously express confidence",

Most TDD sessions focus on the easy to test areas of your code base that are almost never what you experience getting back to your desk. Come learn why TDD is not a fancy practice for the coding elite, but an understandable, obtainable and practical approach to delivering value for every developer, and how, when done properly, will increase communication and design between the business stake holders and developers.\r\nWe will focus on practical steps to moving towards & embracing TDD. We’ll overview the normal roadblocks that people typically run in to, and practical coding strategies to overcome those road blocks on your way to embracing a Test Driven Development lifestyle - make coding without tests as uncomfortable as coding naked! - From the author of Automated Unit Tests chapter in the Wrox Book “Real World .NET, C# and Silverlight - Indispensable Experience from 15 MVPs, we will learn: \r\n* Distinguish between the 4 major elements of automated unit tests. Code, Tests, Testing Framework and Test Runners and how they interact with each other to round out your engineering practices.\r\n* Discover how Mocking Frameworks and DI make your tests easier to read and write in everyday life.\r\n* Dig in to better ways to write and organize your tests so that they communicate intent, document your code for you and bridge the gap between development and business needs.\r\n* We’ll take a more specific look at those “hard to reach” places like the edges of your code, extension methods and other interesting scenarios\r\n \r\n\r\n* Note everyone will leave their cloths on - it’s not that kind of talk!",

        "Abstract": "Concurrent programming is in! Delegating work to many running processes at once can increase most programs' performance and scalability. Many languages have libraries or frameworks that provide tools for writing concurrent code, but far fewer bake concurrency right into the language. The Go programming language not only does, but also provides synchronization across processes when needed through messaging. Go's channels and goroutines provide powerful, scalable, and convenient concurrency without having to download countless third-party packages. These features of the language make concurrent Go programs enjoyable to write and doubly efficient--both in developer time and actual program execution. In this session, attendees will discover the advantages of using Go through the creation of a simple, concurrent web service, and will walk away ready to harness the power of goroutines for fun, productive coding and performant programs.",

No. Why not?\r\n\r\nIt has never been easier to begin building games. The paths to entry are numerous, the resources are abundant, and the benefits are many. A hobby in game development provides an outlet for artistic expression, an opportunity to geek out about math or physics, the chance to make a little money on the side, and, if nothing else, a concrete way to improve your skills as a professional software developer.\r\n\r\nThis session seeks to inspire you to adopt a hobby in game development, and will provide you with a variety of methods and resources for doing so. We will discuss why, as a professional software developer, it may be worth taking a look at game development, and will cover such topics as game jams, fantasy consoles, engines and frameworks, tools for creating graphics and audio, resources for learning, channels for distributing your game, and more.",

Concurrent programming facilitates the use of multiple processors, but is difficult to implement using traditional approaches.

With this knowledge you will begin to think about software architecture differently, and may even decide to introduce concurrency into your next project.\r\n",

We worry that their intelligence will take our jobs, our livelihood, our freedom, and enslave us to their bidding; or at least that’s how it happens in the movies. Popular culture capitalizes on this emotion to sell Terminator tickets and Asimov novels, but this is not our future. We can celebrate Artificial Intelligence as our greatest accomplishment, and harness it for the tool that it really is. This talk addresses our relationship with computers as tools and how we should allow computers to do the work, so people can do the innovating. Our horizon awaits.",

You know the data you want is in there, but digging it out of the built-in data table UI feels like the \"doing it the hard way\" part of an infomercial.  \r\n\r\nNow, imagine being able to shape your data the way that makes it easiest to understand and debug, limited only by your imagination (and time, of course).\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll take a look at the Visual Studio Debugger Visualizer feature, available in all version of Visual Studio (even the free one!) that lets you create your own graphical display of your .NET data structures while debugging. Shape the data the way you want to make it easier to digest -- hide unimportant info, quickly expose deeply nested elements, compare large object graphs, or even instantly search Stack Overflow for help with an Exception.  Display it in whatever way is best for your data and your understanding of it, act on the data and even modify the it from your custom view. We'll talk through the options available to you, some of the limitations, and security risks/considerations involved.\r\n\r\nThis session doesn't require much deep knowledge of .NET, but the examples will primarily be in C#, WinForms and WPF.  You don't need to know any of those beyond what you can Google or find on Stack Overflow, though the results will be useful to novices and well-weathered developers alike. (Note: While there is support for C++ visualizers, that won't be covered in this session.)\r\n",

How many requests am I getting per second? What resources are people asking for? What's throwing errors?\r\n\r\nApplication Insights is an application performance service for web developers. It works across multiple platforms, including .NET, Node.JS, and more. It is designed to watch your applications at the granular level, and report back everything it sees. All this while not impacting your performance.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we will explore adding Application Insights to an existing web application and looking through its cloud-based portal at overview health and performance. Examples from existing production applications will be used to show off many of the features and cool things you can do!",

But implementing a distributed CQRS architecture can be intimidating. If not well designed, it can make your application exponentially more complex and difficult to maintain.\r\n\r\nSo why not start simple?\r\n\r\nUsing the popular .NET library, MediatR, it’s super easy to write simple, testable, scalable CQRS applications.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will explore CQRS and its core concepts while building a mind-blowingly simple ASP.NET Core application with MediatR. We will emphasize separation of concerns, dependency injection, code reuse, thin controllers, and unit testability.

That definition is expanded to include Convolutional Neural Networks and why they are great for image recognition. A sample neural network implemented in Keras and trained with the MNIST dataset will be demostrated to recognize handwritten digits. This session will conclude with an sample iOS application using CoreML to run the neural network directly on a phone and recognize digits in real time.\r\n\r\nYou will leave this session with some ideas on how to begin to approach problems best solved with machine learning algorithms.",

Maybe that someone should be you!\r\n\r\nYou might be thinking how can I help fix this problem as a guy? Will the women around me think I'm sincere? Yes, you can be a big part of the solution. And, yes they might question your sincerity at first, but with time and effort you can show everyone that diversity is important to you too!\r\n\r\nThere will be mistakes along the way and that’s ok. We make mistakes too. But by learning from those mistakes and continuing to try, we can make tech a better place for everyone.\r\n\r\nSome of the topics we'll cover are:\r\n* Why diversity should be important to everyone\r\n* The difference between being an ally and being a knight in shining armor\r\n* What to do if you see inappropriate behavior\r\n* How to make your workplace more inclusive\r\n* Actions matter even when it’s just the guys",

We find clever ways of doing this while keeping up with all the new technologies and the languages in fashion, all the while ignoring the realities of life.\r\n\r\nIn this session, explore an alternate universe in which Event Driven Architecture can power even the most complex mission-critical systems. Learn how communicating asynchronously via events leads to building systems that are autonomous and much more reliable. Embrace asynchrony and autonomy. Make the complex simple.",

Engineers and developers, both in Star Wars and in the real world, have a responsibility to think about the ethics of our work and how it might be repurposed. Talking about good and evil can feel a little abstract, but Star Wars provides a great framework for thinking about morality in the context of our lives and work. This session will discuss ways of deciding for yourself what kinds of projects you are or aren't comfortable working and tips for self-accountability in your career, but all through the lens of characters we know and love from Star Wars - because talking ethics doesn't have to be scary or boring!",

This session will immediately dispel that concern by exposing the minimal syntactic differences between Java and Scala. Participants will then learn how to use Scala for writing cleaner, more readable code. Once you've seen how easy the switch can be, you'll get hooked by its expressive features. Expression-based coding can return a value directly from an if statement and pattern matching can create clear, type checked code paths. This and more allows you to write less boilerplate and more maintainable, business code. You'll leave this session with enough of the basics to be able to make the switch. But be warned, once you go Scala it's hard to go back.",

Regardless of your chosen development platform, the careful composition of more than one type of database can dramatically simplify your application and better handle larger workloads.\r\n \r\n Objectives:\r\n \r\n * Know when to use relational data, and when not to. Fight the urge to normalize everything.\r\n * The secret sauce to scale is often precalculation. Aggregate querying is a huge pinch point for many LOB applications.\r\n * Documents can hold a ton of serialized data that can be formatted and served to users.

GraphQL, by FaceBook, is an attempt to fix the limitations of REST by allowing the client to specify the data it needs via a single endpoint. Servers can expose any data from any source via a typed interface, and clients can gain the freedom to ask for exactly the data they need without over-fetching.

Security vulnerabilities are ultimately just bugs in an application. Catching issues early saves time and money. \r\n\r\nWe’ll talk about what I see developers are doing right. I’ll share the difference between dynamic and static analyzers and where to use them in your process. We’ll talk about tools such as the Zed Attack Proxy, Fiddler, and useful plugins. We’ll also get into activities that will improve security and the process. Activities like Code review, threat modeling, and patching. I’ll highlight the available resources to developers. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a big resource for developers. We’ll also dive into some of the leaders in the application security field.

To help focus our tests to only the code we want to validate, Mocking Frameworks are a powerful tool in our toolbox. Like many tools, if you have an understanding of how the tool works under the hood, you can bend it to your will (and also know where it’ll break if you bend too much).\r\n\r\nIn this session, you’ll learn about the two main types of mocking frameworks: constrained frameworks (like RhinoMocks and Moq) and unconstrained frameworks (such as Typemock Isolator and Telerik JustMock). I’ll dig into how the two actually do their magic and we’ll discuss the pros, cons, and limits of both. We’ll look at examples of how to use the frameworks in your tests, mocking out dependencies from your own code and even third-party logic.\r\n\r\nYou’ll get the most out of this session if you’re comfortable reading C# code and have a general understanding of class inheritance in .NET, along with some experience writing and running unit tests. Prior experience using mocking frameworks is not necessary.",

Leveraging the capabilities of Node.js, you can read and write files, work with databases, speak bespoke IP protocols to control connected devices, and then wrap it all up behind a responsive, quick, and friendly user interface.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll explore a successful Electron application that does all of those things. You'll learn about Electron's general architecture and how it works to make all these things happen. You'll hear about how the team of React, Redux and TypeScript all worked together to make this complex application robust and understandable. We'll talk about lessons learned while building this application, including how some realizations and subsequent refactors simplified it and made it faster and easier to implement new features. We'll cover what was done when performance problems reared their ugly heads so the application could easily handle a hundred state updates per second, smoothly updating metrics and plotting devices' positions on live maps. We'll also talk about what the stack's limitations are, so you know what Electron is good at, helping you to leverage its strengths and avoid its weaknesses.\r\n\r\nIf you've been wondering whether Electron is right for your project, this tour through the development of a complex and successful application will help give you the information you need to make a well-informed decision and get you started using Electron to build it.",

However, some inconsistencies in the implementation of common libraries meant you had to target one environment or another -- never both.\r\n\r\nWith the release of .NET Core, the prophecy of being able to build true cross-platform applications using .NET is coming true! However, it isn't as easy as File, New. Design decisions you make can impact your ability to easy work across platforms.

        "Abstract": "The rendering wars have begun! Front-end templating frameworks like React, Angular, and Ember have all generally settled on a similar component-based paradigm, but they're still differentiated by their vastly different rendering engines. This talk will dive deep into React's rendering engine, codenamed Fiber, and Ember's rendering engine, Glimmer. Both engines have recently revealed brand-new and rewritten implementations aimed at optimizing for performance. Fiber attempts to do as much work as possible between each frame to make sure the browser is always free to paint the page. Glimmer takes a totally different approach; it pre-compiles templates into a bytecode that is then interpreted by a \"virtual machine\" in order to perform the most optimzed updates possible. After we dig deep into the code behind the actual implementation of each engine, attendees to this talk will walk away with an in-depth understanding contemporary renderers along with some knowledge about what factors to consider when trying to choose a framework.",

This type of behavior often leads to deep frustration and despair, as people in these kinds of environments seem to only respond to negative and often dramatic communication. However, this type of dysfunction is not usually the fault of any one person or group of people on the team but is the result of the team's inability to recognize and deal with a needed change in a positive and healthy way. In this interactive discussion, you will use the latest in behavioral change modeling to learn how to identify the stages of change. You will come to understand and leverage the decisional balance shifts at each stage. You will discover ways to help people move forward in modifying unwanted behaviors in a healthy way. And, most importantly, you will find out how to support people in maintaining those behavior changes into the future. This session will give you the tools you need to help move a team from dysfunctional to functional without having to remove a single head. ",

When you go back to the real world and are faced with real-world code where simplistic principles are hard to apply, there's seldom anyone next to you to show you what's a bad test: you have to learn to to identify bad tests the hard way, by writing them and then\r\ndiscovering that they don't test what you think they test.\r\n\r\nBut in this talk, we'll discuss exactly how to write the world's worst tests, with a number of examples from real life and detailed evaluations of just why those tests are so bad. You'll learn fundamental principles for writing bad tests, so that this time when you go back to the world, you can write bad tests with perfect intention and purpose.\r\n\r\nOr not: your choice.\r\n",

        "Abstract": "Automated browser tests can be a nightmare to write and maintain. Unlike unit tests they’re tough to set up, slow to run, make permanent changes to data in the system, and they’re incredibly brittle. Even a tiny CSS change can result in cascading failures!\r\n\r\nYou can’t *totally* avoid these issues, but you CAN manage them by adopting a few key patterns and techniques. This session explores the lessons learned by one product team as they moved from manual regression testing to an automated process using Canopy and Selenium. You’ll go beyond the basics of single-page testing and see real-world suggestions for managing test data, executing complex and multi-page tests, organizing and writing test code, and coping with “permutation explosion”. You’ll also learn techniques for involving the entire cross-functional team in the process.\r\n\r\nThis session is designed for developers and architects that know how to automate the browser, but are struggling to leverage that knowledge into a suite of maintainable UI tests that provide acceptable ROI. It focuses on patterns and principles, not a specific automation technology.\r\n",

Ubiquitous language, proper boundaries, encapsulation, it all made sense.\r\n\r\nBut along the way, something went completely and utterly wrong. It started with arguments on the proper way of implementing aggregates and entities. Arguments began over project and folder structure. Someone read a blog post that repositories are evil, and ORMs the devil incarnate. Another read that relational databases are last century, we need to store everything as a stream of events. Then came the actor model and frameworks that sounded like someone clearing their throat. Instead of a nice, clean architecture, the team chased the next new approach without ever actually shipping anything.\r\n\r\nBeyond the endless technical arguments it causes, domain-driven design can actually produce great software. We have to look past the hype into the true value of DDD, what it can bring to our organizations and how it can enable us to build quality systems. With the advent of microservices, DDD is more important than ever - but only if we can get to the good parts.",

Event driven systems coupled with actor models can be a way to solve this problem.  In this session, we'll walk through how to solve the sports scenario described earlier using an event driven architecture and an actor model to process the data.  Some tools and libraries we'll look at include Akka.NET, Elm, and RethinkDB.  After this session, you'll have an appreciation of event driven architecture, how actor models can help with these architectures, and how you can start building one today.",

LINQ and Entity Framework are both commonly used in the .Net ecosystem, but even well-written applications can have LINQ queries that are difficult to understand. Because LINQ is so flexible, it can be written in ways that fail to communicate the developer’s intent. Well-written LINQ should be so clear as to be self-documenting. To write clear LINQ, it helps to understand the details of a few LINQ components that improve LINQ’s readability.\r\n\r\nWe’ll be showing how to use a pipe and filter pattern to make LINQ queries easier to comprehend.

This talk will look at some of the interesting issues that arise when securing real world services and give some practical advice for those dealing with this task based on the presenters experiences. This talk will cover security-relevant architectural and design changes that arise when migrating to a micro-services architecture, and will provide recommendations on how to leverage the benefits and address the challenges from these changes.\r\n\r\nIn this talk you will learn:\r\n* Security-related architectural and design concerns related to micro-services\r\n* How these architectural changes benefit and challenge security in a system\r\n* Questions you need to address as an architect or developer to ensure appropriate security protections exist in your system\r\n* Provide hard-earned recommendations on how to leverage the benefits and address the challenges from these fundamental architectural changes to better secure your systems (read: I failed so hopefully you don't have to!)\r\n* Pointers to open-source tools that can be applied to benefit from these changes\r\n* How your team, architecture, developers, and operations staff are affected by the fundamental changes: and how to take advantage of the new paradigm to gain greater security\r\n",

How can we take advantage of this fundamental tool without falling victim to its pitfalls?\r\n\r\nJoin me as we journey through the wonderful world of recursion where we will discover a treasure trove of recursive techniques, including tail recursion, mutual recursion, and trampolines. We will also learn how tail call optimization is achieved (or not) in various languages.

While a healthy, advantaged person may not have to worry about running out of ‘spoons,’ people with chronic illnesses or disabilities and members of marginalized communities often have to consider how they must ration their energy in order to get through the day. Understanding how 'spoons' can affect the lives of your developers and teammates can help companies lessen the everyday burdens on their underrepresented employees, leaving them more spoons to do their best work, avoid burnout and lead fulfilling lives.\r\nThis session will go over examples of how different people spend spoons in different ways and why empathy is so important!

The Programmable Web now boasts over 18K APIs in it’s directory and the pace of publishing is accelerating.  Every organization will need to provide or use REST APIs.  Whether your team is a backend resource or API provider, client app development team, or you live in between these two as a proxy, you would benefit from a robust test framework.  This session opens with a brief overview of the API landscape and unfolds the evolution of a test framework.  Developed initially for API proxy developers, who needed simple, scripted, headless REST call and validation while maintaining client state; its execution model expanded for improved decoupling of API calls and asserts, API independence from client/provider, and dev/run perspectives.  The concepts presented are applicable whether you choose to ‘roll your own’ solution or extend an existing REST testing client like Postman.",

If that sounds wrong to you, let's talk about polymorphism and more in languages like Clojure, Elixir, and even Haskell! So where does object-oriented programming (OOP) end and functional programming (FP) begin?\r\n\r\nIn this session, you’ll learn to look at these programming paradigms with a more critical eye, focusing on where FP and OOP folks fundamentally disagree, where these paradigms have more in common than the industry's rhetoric suggests, and how you can use those insights to make better decisions about the software you build.",

Not only that, when the device gets back online, your app needs to gracefully handle data synchronization and any data conflicts as well.\r\n\r\nIn this session, I will share with you hard earned lessons on how to solve the problem of online/offline data resiliency and synchronization using Azure Mobile App Services based on using it in multiple Xamarin projects. You will learn how to solve the issues that arise with improper client-side data schemas, pushing data to the server without knowing when the connection will be interrupted, and reconciling conflicting data between the server and the app. At the end of this session you'll be well equipped to have your app ready for anything.",

You’ll learn how a CPU turns the code we feed it into actions, what’s the big difference between an ARM and an Intel processor, how CPUs constantly optimize work for us, and where is it all going for the next few years.\r\n",

If your team is struggling, maybe you are missing an important part of the puzzle.  This talk will be the story of XP and a review of the Values, Principles, and Practices.

This presentation aims to change that!\r\nThe goal of the presentation is to show you why you should be using SVG, and how to use it. SVG is always responsive. SVG files are significantly smaller and simpler than raster images (jpg, png, gif). SVG allows for extensive animation.\r\nMost importantly, you can programmatically edit images in the browser! Do you have a green logo that you need to be white in certain places? This use case happens frequently, and is very easy to handle using SVG.\r\nBy the end of the presentation, you will know more about SVG than 99.999% of the planet. Wow!

In this talk, Amanda Lange from Microsoft will use knowledge of the HoloLens and Oculus Rift to dive into some of these questions. This talk will focus on the Unity 3D Engine but also deliver practical design and dev tips that will help in these types of applications regardless of development platform of choice.

        "Abstract": "When should we test our data? From an application development perspective, a unit test against a database isn't a unit test at all. Which makes sense -- connected systems introduce overhead and dependency, both of which reduce stability and decrease productivity during test-driven development (TDD). But if we wait for integration testing, critical functionality can get missed. In this session, we will discuss strategies for filling the data testing gap, directly within a Microsoft SQL Server environment. If you do a lot of work in T-SQL but aren't familiar with TDD, you'll learn the why and how of test-first development. If you're accomplished with unit tests, but never tried them in your database, you'll learn how to apply familiar concepts like setup, mocking, and assertion. We'll spend most of our time walking through a solution based on a real-world project, specifically using the open source tSQLt database unit testing framework.",

        "Abstract": "CRUD apps destroy data.\r\n\r\nDelete is an obviously destructive operation, but Update is no better. Updates overwrite the data that was once present. What would software look like if the only valid operations were Create and Read?\r\n\r\nHistorical Modeling is a technique for designing and building software systems that permit only inserts, no updates, no deletes. The only way to \"modify\" an object is to insert related records. You can then read the state of the object by querying for the presence or absence of those related records. We'll start with the assumption that all records are immutable and indelible. From there, we'll build a set of patterns that yield some surprising benefits.\r\n\r\nWith a historical model, synchronizing disparate nodes is trivial: just insert what you don't yet have. Building offline-first web applications is easy. Viewing a snapshot of the system at any point in the past is a simple query.\r\n\r\nLet's build a historical model together, and see these benefits for ourselves. Let's put aside the assumptions of CRUD applications and discover a whole new set of patterns. Once you master these techniques, you will never destroy data again.\r\n",

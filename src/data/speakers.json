So it was no surprise that he developed an affinity for technology early on that eventually culminated in a degree in computer science and engineering. A life-long fan of fantasy and science fiction, he parlayed his coding skills and penchant for storytelling into the applied application of user experience on the Web. Nowadays Ben can be found practicing appreciative inquiry and information architecture, taking the time to speak, coach, and teach on these subjects whenever possible. His wife keeps him grounded while indulging his fancy for gadgets, geek culture, and Game of Thrones and together they do their best to raise their three boys.",

After flirting with several career paths in college, he decided to stick with what he knew.\r\n\r\nCam's development and IT career began in 1991 when a small town computer consultant took Cam, then 13 years old, as his apprentice. After graduating from Missouri State University in 1999, Cam worked as a trainer, adjunct professor, and freelance developer until he took a full-time developer job in the financial services industry in 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, Cam achieved his childhood dream of joining Microsoft as a travelling support engineer, where he helped companies and public institutions of all sizes deploy software for .NET and Azure. He is currently part of the Microsoft APEX (Azure Platform Evangelism and Experiences) team, where he writes content about Azure and .NET on docs.microsoft.com, including reference applications and samples. \r\n\r\nCam lives in Kansas City, Missouri, USA with his wife, three sons, two dogs, two cats, three guinea pigs, and two hermit crabs.

He's a long-time Sys/Ops Engineer, enjoys leading teams, and is active in the DevOps community.  He may or may not be Batman.  He is pretty keen on helping orgs stop hurting themselves, insight tooling (trending / monitoring / alerting), and automation in general, and actually enjoys public speaking.  He takes joy in helping teams and orgs to stop hurting themselves.  He hates writing about himself in the third person, and aspires to one day be a better bio writer.",

Just a few days after discovering how to move pixels around a computer screen he was devouring books on the topic of computer graphics and UI design. Before long he was sharing his discoveries with other technology buffs, a lifelong pursuit that has led to teaching engagements at universities, private training companies and the international conference circuit. His experimentation continues to this day, ranging from writing API extensions, learning about IDEs, mobile development and the web. As a consultant he has worked with a wide spectrum of clients, including UPS, HP, Wintellect and Intel. He is now a staff instructor at LinkedIn Learning, where his content team produces hundreds of technical training courses for software developers each year.\r\nIn an earlier phase of life, he was a professional musician, first working jobs as a trombonist, later exploring music with keyboards and synthesizers.
